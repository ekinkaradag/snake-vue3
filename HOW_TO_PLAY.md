# How to play ðŸ“•

- The game is played in a 35x35 grid.
- The player starts as a single **cell** snake with a random direction.
- The player can navigate the snake via W, A, S, D keys or the arrow keys (â¬†, â¬…, â¬‡, âž¡).
- The player needs to navigate the snake to the snack in order to have the snake grow and gain score.
- Each eaten snack contributes 1 point to the score.
- If the snake hits its own tail, then the game is over.
