## Rules 📕

- The game is played in a 35x35 grid.
- The player starts as a single **cell** snake with a random direction.
- The player can navigate the snake via W, A, S, D keys or the arrow keys (⬆, ⬅, ⬇, ➡).
- The player needs to navigate the snake to the snack in order to have the snake grow and gain score.
- Each eaten snack contributes 1 point to the score.
- If the snake hits its own tail, then the game is over.
- Rules of "Play without borders":
  - If the snake hits the grid borders, it will continue to move in the same direction from the opposite end.
- Rules of "Play with borders":
  - If the snake hits the grid boundaries, then the game is over.
